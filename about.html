        Imagine a world where adequate data is made available at one's disposal
        before any step or decision is made. It will help guide you against any
        mishap that would have arisen from inadequate data. The power that
        appropriate data provision provides is what inspired the creation of the
        U-Weather Web App. Access, as well as the assessment of weather trends,
        will enable the user to make informed outing decisions without having to
        worry over a sudden change in weather that could keep one stranded or
        ruin a nice event. The U-Weather App provides accurate weather data to
        the user as well as a five-day forecast. This is to ensure the smooth
        planning of outdoor events. This is a Portfolio Project for
